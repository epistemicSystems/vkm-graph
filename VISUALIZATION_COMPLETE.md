## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Beauty First (PRD Requirement)
âœ… Gorgeous visualization before data pipeline
âœ… Premium visual quality
âœ… Smooth, delightful interactions
âœ… Polish over features

### 2. Information-Driven Architecture (Rich Hickey)
âœ… Data (patches) separate from presentation
âœ… Pure functions for transformations
âœ… Immutable structures
âœ… Types as specifications

### 3. Do Things That Don't Scale (Paul Graham)
âœ… Hand-crafted synthetic data
âœ… 5 snapshots (not 100)
âœ… Perfect before production
âœ… Learn fast, iterate

### 4. Explorable Explanations (Bret Victor)
âœ… Scrub through time to explore
âœ… Immediate visual feedback
âœ… No hidden state
âœ… Direct manipulation

## What Makes This Special

### 1. **It Actually Shows Evolution**
Not just final state, but the *journey* of understanding developing

### 2. **Confidence Visualization**
The gray â†’ gold gradient makes belief strength instantly visible

### 3. **Smooth Interactions**
Timeline scrubber feels natural, like controlling time itself

### 4. **Force-Directed Beauty**
Physics simulation makes relationships organic and discoverable

### 5. **Real Data Structure**
Synthetic data follows actual EDN schemas from backend

## Next Steps

### Week 3-4: Wire to Real Data
- Replace synthetic data with API calls
- Connect to Clojure backend
- Real-time patch loading
- Document upload component

### Week 5-6: Claude Gallery
- Topic generation (10 pre-generated topics)
- Gallery browse interface
- Authenticity validation

### Week 7-8: Production Pipeline
- YouTube video ingestion
- Full end-to-end flow
- Performance optimization (5K+ facts)

### Future Enhancements
- 3D visualization option
- Search/filter interface
- Export to PNG/SVG/video
- Collaborative annotations
- VR/AR support

## How to Customize

### Change Colors

Edit `viz/src/config.ts`:

```typescript
colors: {
  confidence: {
    low: '#9CA3AF',    // Your gray
    medium: '#FCD34D', // Your yellow
    high: '#F59E0B',   // Your gold
  }
}
```

### Change Physics

```typescript
physics: {
  chargeStrength: -300,  // Stronger = more repulsion
  linkDistance: 100,     // Longer = more space
  alphaDecay: 0.02,      // Faster = quicker settling
}
```

### Add Your Own Patches

See `viz/src/data/syntheticData.ts` for structure.

Create patches with:
- Facts (claims with confidence)
- Edges (relationships)
- Metadata (description, topic)

## Philosophy

> "Commit histories are proofs, patches are theorems, and understanding is the process of watching structure emerge."

This visualization makes that philosophy **visible**.

You're not just seeing factsâ€”you're watching understanding *evolve*.
